# Tibber collector

Collect upcoming Tibber energy prices and push them to InfluxDB.

This is a companion service to the [SENEC Charger](https://github.com/solectrus/senec-charger), which allows you to charge your SENEC.Home battery when energy is cheap.

## Usage

1. Prepare an `.env` file (see `.env.example`)

2. Run the Docker containers on your Linux box:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

In the `senec-charger` repository you can find an [example](https://github.com/solectrus/senec-charger/blob/develop/compose.yml) of how to use `tibber-collector` with the SENEC charger.

It's recommended to add `tibber-collector` and `senec-charger` to your [SOLECTRUS hosting](https://github.com/solectrus/hosting).
